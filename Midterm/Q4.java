4. (10 pts) Explain how the following work together to help programmers produce working
code:
• Integrated Development Environment
• Compiler
• Debugger


An integrated development environment (IDE) is a program that has many tools including code editor, compiler, and debugger. The tools in IDE's makes it easier to put your code together.
A compiler takes the source code (code written by a programmer) and converts it into something the computer can understand (machine code).
If there are any errors while the code is being compiled, then the IDE has a debugger that will display where the error occurs.
